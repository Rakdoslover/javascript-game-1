# Stricken Down

## [Live Site](https://rakdoslover.github.io/javascript-game-1/)

## Purpose of the Site

My mission was to create a simple site with a "rock, paper, scissors" like game
with a little fantasy twist.
The name of my site is Stricken Down!, which is also the prompt you get when you lose.
You choose one out of five alternatives at the same time as the computer and then
you either win, lose or draw.

Sword beats Shield.
Shield beats Spear.
Arcane beats Cannon.
Cannon beats Sword.
Spear beats Arcane.

Went back over most of the lessons on the Javascript and some things for the HTMl/CSS
to get through the main content of the site. I've also used the template made by CI published on Github as a layout, can be found here [GitHub](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/love-running-2.0-sourcecode).
